=== ToDo's (just my own persoanl list dw about the contents or it being up to date~) ===
- [1] blocker positioning helper
- [1] better progressbar
- [1] drag and drop positioning
- [1] wurm identification / timer adjustment
- [1] fancy fade animation for the blocker window instead of just appearing and leaving
- [1] rotating positioning helper
- [1] mount detection
- [-] Hotkeys?! can be weird but atleast for mesmer it would work quite well i guess? more complex classes cant be done that way though
- [-] option to hide if the map is open
- [-] class identification / block capabilities
- [-] class based quick blocker tutorial
- [-] commander detect
- [-] bug panel
- [F] timer bar bug on gathering spot
- [F] new panel location is sometimes not stored after drag stopped (apparently connected somehow to being in the proper spot it seems? can also be a debug thing with all the focus switches only worth looking into if it is reported during actual usage)
- [-] room integration with that one website
- [-] time colors flashing red
- [-] audio?
- [-] gathering spot based squad identification?
- [-] yellow title / make it look more like the achievements section thingy?
- [1] Configurable bar colors
- [-] Check memory handling (Disposing, unecessary variables, extended scopes, etc.)
- [-] Upgrade the base blishhud version since the original template was just outdated and new stuff uses async textures?
- [-] The everlasting quest for that last tiny bit of performance (or actually worrying about that in the first place)
- [-] Worry about a coherent coding style to please all the OCD people out there (no mixmatch of variable naming conventions, use either var or proper variable types, etc.)
- [ ] Option to either show the panel outside of the arena whilst its still active oooooor show time the current notification overshoot whilst being outside the arena
- [ ] reset the timers on arena swap (blockers sometimes do swaps if stuff goes downhill)
- [ ] use window resolution for panel positioning instead of screen resolution
- [ ] Husk Spots marker

Some more stuff / first impressions
- [1] Bar filling up
- [1] Buttons bigger
- [1] Bigger bars (maybe with texts)

[-] = not even looked at, [1] = first pass done (idea implemented in a first version), [2] = second pass done (validated for being actually usefull), [3] = polished, [F] = bug? bug! bug. bug~
